            "He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the stairs. His closet of a room was under the roof of a high, five-floor house and was more like a cupboard than a place in which to live. The landlady who provided him with the room and with dinner and service lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which was always open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him grimace and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady and was afraid of meeting her.\n",
            "\n",
            "This was not because he was cowardly and browbeaten, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself and isolated from everyone else that he dreaded meeting not only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but even the anxieties of his position had recently ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. In fact, nothing that any landlady could do held any terror for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, all the while racking his brains for excuses, avoiding the issue, lying — no, he would rather creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, when he emerged onto the street that evening, he became acutely aware of his fears.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm . . . yes, everything is in someone’s hands and they let it all slip out of cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is people are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most . . . But I am talking too much. It’s because I babble that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I babble because I do nothing. I’ve learned to babble this last month, lying for days on end in my corner thinking . . . just nonsense. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that seriously possible? I’m not serious about it at all. It’s just a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle, the plaster, the scaffolding, the bricks and the dust all around him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to everyone who is unable to get out of town during the summer — all worked painfully upon the young man’s already overwrought nerves. The unbearable stench from the taverns, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a weekday, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the deepest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon, though, he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was around him and not caring to observe it. From time to time, because he used to talk to himself, he would mutter something, a habit to which he had just confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had had almost nothing to eat.\n",
            "\n",
            "He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that part of town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. Due to the proximity of the Haymarket, the number of establishments of a certain kind and the overwhelming numbers of craftsmen and workers crowded in these streets and alleys at the center of Petersburg, so many different types of people were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however strange, would have caused surprise. But there was such accumulated spite and contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the cares of youth, he minded his rags least of all. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge cart dragged by a heavy cart-horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past, “Hey there, German hatter,” bellowing at the top of his voice and pointing at him — the young man stopped suddenly and clutched trembling at his hat. It was a tall round one from Zimmermann’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most hideous fashion. Not shame, however, but another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\n",

It opened silently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.  Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers' offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore's was by far the most interesting. If he hadn't been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it.  It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard's hat - the Sorting Hat.\\u00a0  Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him in the right House  He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he'd put it on. Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in his ear, \\\\Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Er, yes,\\\\\\\" Harry muttered. \\\\\\\"Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask - \\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You've been wondering whether I put you in the right House,\\\\\\\" said the hat smartly. \\\\\\\"Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said before\\\\\\\" - Harry's heart leapt - \\\\\\\"you would have done well in Slytherin -\\\\\\\"  Harry's stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.  \\\\\\\"You're wrong,\\\\\\\" he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn't move. Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around.  He wasn't alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.  Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore's  pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.  Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn't see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering pile of ash on the floor.  The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.  \\\\\\\"Professor,\\\\\\\" Harry gasped. \\\\\\\"Your bird - I couldn't do anything - he just caught fire -\\\\\\\"  To Harry's astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.  \\\\\\\"About time, too,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"He's been looking dreadful for days; I've been telling him to get a move on.\\\\\\\"  He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry's face.  \\\\\\\"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him . . .\\\\\\\"  Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.  \\\\\\\"It's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk. \\\\\\\"He's really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.\\\\\\\"  In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled  himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare.  Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.  \\\\\\\"It wasn' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\\\\\\\" said Hagrid urgently. \\\\\\\"I was talkin' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir - \\\\\\\"  Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere.  \\\\\\\"- it can't've bin him, I'll swear it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic if I have to -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hagrid, I -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never ='  \\\\\\\"Hagrid!\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore loudly. \\\\\\\"I do not think that Harry attacked those people.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \\\\\\\"Right. I'll wait outside then, Headmaster.\\\\\\\"  And he stomped out looking embarrassed.  \\\\\\\"You don't think it was me, Professor?\\\\\\\" Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.  \\\\\\\"No, Harry, I don't,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again. \\\\\\\"But I still want to talk to you.\\\\\\\"  Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,\\\\\\\" he said gently. \\\\\\\"Anything at all.\\\\\\\"  Harry didn't know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, \\\\\\\"You'll be next, Mudbloods!\\\\\\\" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: \\\\\\\"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\\\\\\\" He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin ....  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"There isn't anything, Professor . . . .\\\\\\\"  The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas.  \\\\\\\"At this rate, we'll be the only ones left,\\\\\\\" Ron told Harry and Hermione. \\\\\\\"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it's going to be.\\\\\\\"  Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.\\u00a0  Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, \\\\\\\"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through ......  Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.  \\\\\\\"It is not a laughing matter,\\\\\\\" he said coldly.  \\\\\\\"Oh, get out of the way, Percy,\\\\\\\" said Fred. \\\\\\\"Harry's in a hurry.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeah, he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant,\\\\\\\" said George, chortling.  Ginny didn't find it amusing either.  \\\\\\\"Oh, don't,\\\\\\\" she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met.  Harry didn't mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.  \\\\\\\"It's because he's bursting to say it's really him,\\\\\\\" said Ron knowingly. \\\\\\\"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you're getting all the credit for his dirty work.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Not for long,\\\\\\\" said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \\\\\\\"The Polyjuice Potion's nearly ready. We'll be getting the truth out of him any day now.\\\\\\\"  At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could\\u00a0play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time.  Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.  \\\\\\\"Wake up,\\\\\\\" she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.  \\\\\\\"Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here -\\\\\\\" said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.  \\\\\\\"Merry Christmas to you, too,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, throwing him his present. \\\\\\\"I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It's ready.\\\\\\\"  Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.  \\\\\\\"Are you sure?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Positive,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four-poster. \\\\\\\"If we're going to do it, I say it should be tonight.\\\\\\\"  At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak.  \\\\\\\"Hello,\\\\\\\" said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \\\\\\\"Are you speaking to me again?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0  She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.  The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.  No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.  The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \\\\\\\"Pinhead,\\\\\\\" kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn't even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks\\u00a0 about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours' time.  Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.  \\\\\\\"We still need a bit of the people you're changing into,\\\\\\\" said Hermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. \\\\\\\"And obviously, it'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoys best friends, he'll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating him.  \\\\\\\"I've got it all worked out,\\\\\\\" she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry's and Ron's stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. \\\\\\\"I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they're bound to eat them. Once they're asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.\\\\\\\"  Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.  \\\\\\\"Hermione, I don't think -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That could go seriously wrong -\\\\\\\"  But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had.  \\\\\\\"The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair,\\\\\\\" she said sternly. \\\\\\\"You do want to investigate Malfoy, don't you?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh, all right, all right,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"But what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"I've already got mine!\\\\\\\" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. \\\\\\\"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she's gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell the Slytherins I've decided to come back.\\\\\\\"  When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.  \\\\\\\"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?\\\\\\\"  But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.  \\\\\\\"How thick can you get?\\\\\\\" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor.  By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's fore\\u00a0head and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe's hairs. They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.  They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.  \\\\\\\"Hermione?\\\\\\\"  They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny- faced and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat.  \\\\\\\"Did you get them?\\\\\\\" Hermione asked breathlessly.  Harry showed her Goyle's hair.  \\\\\\\"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,\\\\\\\" Hermione said, holding up a small sack. \\\\\\\"You'll need bigger sizes once you're Crabbe and Goyle.\\\\\\\"  The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.  \\\\\\\"I'm sure I've done everything right,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \\\\\\\"It looks like the book says it should ... once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Now what?\\\\\\\" Ron whispered.  \\\\\\\"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.\\\\\\\"  Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out of its bottle into the first glass.\\u00a0  The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.  \\\\\\\"Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\\\\\\\" said Ron, eyeing it with loathing. \\\\\\\"Bet it tastes disgusting.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Add yours, then,\\\\\\\" said Hermione.  Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe's into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle's turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe's a dark, murky brown.  \\\\\\\"Hang on,\\\\\\\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses. \\\\\\\"We'd better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won't fit. And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie.  \\\\\\\"Good thinking,\\\\\\\" said Ron, unlocking the door. \\\\\\\"We'll take separate stalls.\\\\\\\"  Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall.  \\\\\\\"Ready?\\\\\\\" he called.  \\\\\\\"Ready,\\\\\\\" came Ron's and Hermione's voices.  \\\\\\\"One - two - three -\\\\\\\"  Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage.  Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowed live snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened,\\u00a0the knuckles were bulging like bolts -his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small  As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them - he took them off and called, \\\\\\\"Are you two okay?\\\\\\\" Goyle's low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.  \\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.  Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror. Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle.  Ron's door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.  \\\\\\\"This is unbelievable,\\\\\\\" said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe's flat nose. \\\\\\\"Unbelievable. \\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We'd better get going,\\\\\\\" said Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle's thick wrist. \\\\\\\"We've still got to find out\\u00a0where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find someone to follow. . .\\\\\\\"  Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \\\\\\\"You don't know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\\\\\\\" He banged on Hermione's door. \\\\\\\"C'mon, we need to go -\\\\\\\"  A high-pitched voice answered him.  \\\\\\\"I - I don't think I'm going to come after all. You go on without me.  \\\\\\\"Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode's ugly, no one's going to know it's you -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No - really - I don't think I'll come. You two hurry up, you re wasting time  Harry looked at Ron, bewildered.  \\\\\\\"That looks more like Goyle,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"That's how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hermione, are you okay?\\\\\\\" said Harry through the door.  \\\\\\\"Fine - I'm fine - go on -\\\\\\\"  Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed.  \\\\\\\"We'll meet you back here, all right?\\\\\\\" he said.  Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off.  \\\\\\\"Don't swing your arms like that,\\\\\\\" Harry muttered to Ron.  \\\\\\\"Eh?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Crabbe holds them sort of stiff . . . .\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"How's this?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeah, that's better . . . .\\\\\\\"  They went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was\\u00a0a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around.  \\\\\\\"Any ideas?\\\\\\\" muttered Harry.  \\\\\\\"The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,\\\\\\\" said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance.  \\\\\\\"Excuse me,\\\\\\\" said Ron, hurrying up to her. \\\\\\\"We've forgotten the way to our common room.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I beg your pardon?\\\\\\\" said the girl stiffly. \\\\\\\"Our common room? I'm a Ravenclaw.\\\\\\\"  She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.  Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe's and Goyle's huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as they had hoped.  The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.  \\\\\\\"Ha!\\\\\\\" said Ron excitedly. \\\\\\\"There's one of them now!\\\\\\\"  The figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn't a Slytherin, it was Percy.  \\\\\\\"What're you doing down here?\\\\\\\" said Ron in surprise.  Percy looked affronted.  \\\\\\\"That,\\\\\\\" he said stiffly, \\\\\\\"is none of your business. It's Crabbe, isn't it?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"Wh - oh, yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"Well, get off to your dormitories,\\\\\\\" said Percy sternly. \\\\\\\"It's not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You are,\\\\\\\" Ron pointed out.  \\\\\\\"I,\\\\\\\" said Percy, drawing himself up, \\\\\\\"am a prefect. Nothing's about to attack me.\\\\\\\"  A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him.  \\\\\\\"There you are,\\\\\\\" he drawled, looking at them. \\\\\\\"Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I've been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.\\\\\\\"  Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.  \\\\\\\"And what're you doing down here, Weasley?\\\\\\\" he sneered.  Percy looked outraged.  \\\\\\\"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"I don't like your attitude!\\\\\\\"  Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the next passage, \\\\\\\"That Peter Weasley -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Percy,\\\\\\\" Ron corrected him automatically.  \\\\\\\"Whatever,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy. \\\\\\\"I've noticed him sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he's up to. He thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's heir single-handed.\\\\\\\"  He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks.  Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"What's the new password again?\\\\\\\" he said to Harry.  \\\\\\\"Er -\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"Oh, yeah -pure-blood!\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron followed him.  The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.  \\\\\\\"Wait here,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire. \\\\\\\"I'll go and get it my father's just sent it to me -\\\\\\\"  Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at home.  Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron's nose.  \\\\\\\"That'll give you a laugh,\\\\\\\" he said.  Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry.  It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said:  INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC  Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.  Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the\\u00a0enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr. Weasley's resignation.  \\\\\\\"Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,\\\\\\\" Mr. Malfoy told our reporter. \\\\\\\"He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.\\\\\\\"  Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told reporters to clear off or she'd set the family ghoul on them.  \\\\\\\"Well?\\\\\\\" said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to him. \\\\\\\"Don't you think it's funny?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Ha, ha,\\\\\\\" said Harry bleakly.  \\\\\\\"Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy scornfully. \\\\\\\"You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.\\\\\\\"  Ron's - or rather, Crabbe's - face was contorted with fury.  \\\\\\\"What's up with you, Crabbe?\\\\\\\" snapped Malfoy.  \\\\\\\"Stomachache,\\\\\\\" Ron grunted.  \\\\\\\"Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, snickering. \\\\\\\"You know, I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet,\\\\\\\" he went on thoughtfully. \\\\\\\"I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up. He'll be sacked if it doesn't stop soon. Father's always said old Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A decent headmaster would never've let slime like that Creevey in.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\"\",\n          \"THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR  In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.  It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.  They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.  Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.  Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.  Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.  \\\\That was far easier than I thought it would be,\\\\\\\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \\\\\\\"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\\\\\\\"  Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \\\\\\\"No more studying,\\\\\\\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \\\\\\\"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.\\\\\\\"  Harry was rubbing his forehead.  \\\\\\\"I wish I knew what this means!\\\\\\\" he burst out angrily. \\\\\\\"My scar keeps hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\\\\\\\" Hermione suggested.  \\\\\\\"I'm not ill,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I think it's a warning... it means danger's coming....\\\\\\\"  Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.  \\\\\\\"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\\\\\\\"  Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \\\\\\\"That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.\\\\\\\"  Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --  Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.  \\\\\\\"Where're you going?\\\\\\\" said Ron sleepily.   \\\\\\\"I've just thought of something,\\\\\\\" said Harry. He had turned white. \\\\\\\"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Why?\\\\\\\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.  \\\\\\\"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\\\\\\\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \\\\\\\"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What are you talking about?\\\\\\\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.  Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.  \\\\\\\"Hullo,\\\\\\\" he said, smiling. \\\\\\\"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yes, please,\\\\\\\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.  \\\\\\\"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Dunno,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid casually, \\\\\\\"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\\\\\\\"  He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.  \\\\\\\"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head -- that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\\\\\\\"  Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \\\\\\\"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Mighta come up,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \\\\\\\"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here.... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an' then... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks.... Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?\\\\\\\" Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.  \\\\\\\"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep --\\\\\\\"  Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.  \\\\\\\"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\\\\\\\" he blurted out. \\\\\\\"Forget I said it! Hey -- where're yeh goin'?\\\\\\\"  Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.  \\\\\\\"We've got to go to Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him. Where's Dumbledore's office?\\\\\\\"  They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.  \\\\\\\"We'll just have to --\\\\\\\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.  \\\\\\\"What are you three doing inside?\\\\\\\"  It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.  \\\\\\\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.  \\\\\\\"See Professor Dumbledore?\\\\\\\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \\\\\\\"Why?\\\\\\\"  Harry swallowed -- now what?  \\\\\\\"It's sort of secret,\\\\\\\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.  \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\\\\\\\" she said coldly. \\\\\\\"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He's gone?\\\\\\\" said Harry frantically. \\\\\\\"Now?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time --  \\\\\\\"But this is important.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter.  \\\\\\\"Look,\\\\\\\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \\\\\\\"Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's tone --\\\\\\\"  Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up. \\\\\\\"How do you know --?\\\\\\\" she spluttered.  \\\\\\\"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone's going to try and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\\\\\\\"  She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.  \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\\\\\\\" she said finally. I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But Professor --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Potter, I know what I'm talking about,\\\\\\\" she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\\\\\\\"  But they didn't.  \\\\\\\"It's tonight,\\\\\\\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \\\\\\\"Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But what can we --\\\\\\\"  Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.  Snape was standing there.  \\\\\\\"Good afternoon,\\\\\\\" he said smoothly.  They stared at him.  \\\\\\\"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this,\\\\\\\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile.  \\\\\\\"We were --\\\\\\\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.  \\\\\\\"You want to be more careful,\\\\\\\" said Snape. \\\\\\\"Hanging around  like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?\\\\\\\"  Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.  \\\\\\\"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\\\\\\\"  He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.  Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.  \\\\\\\"Right, here's what we've got to do,\\\\\\\" he whispered urgently. \\\\\\\"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Why me?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It's obvious,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\\\\\\\" He put on a high voice, \\\\\\\"'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh, shut up,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.  \\\\\\\"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\\\\\\\" Harry told Ron. \\\\\\\"Come on.\\\\\\\"  But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.  \\\\\\\"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\\\\\\\" she stormed. \\\\\\\"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you 've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\\\\\\\" Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \\\\\\\"At least Hermione's on Snape's tail,\\\\\\\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.  \\\\\\\"I'm sorry, Harry!\\\\\\\" she wailed. \\\\\\\"Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well, that's it then, isn't it?\\\\\\\" Harry said.  The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.  \\\\\\\"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You're mad!\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"You can't!\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You'll be expelled!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"SO WHAP\\\\\\\" Harry shouted. \\\\\\\"Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\\\\\\\"  He glared at them.  \\\\\\\"You're right Harry,\\\\\\\" said Hermione in a small voice.  \\\\\\\"I'll use the invisibility cloak,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"It's just lucky I got it back.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But will it cover all three of us?\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"All -- all three of us?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Of course not,\\\\\\\" said Hermione briskly. \\\\\\\"How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Not if I can help it,\\\\\\\" said Hermione grimly. \\\\\\\"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not throwing me out after that.\\\\\\\"  After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.  Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.  \\\\\\\"Better get the cloak,\\\\\\\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't feel much like singing.  He ran back down to the common room.  \\\\\\\"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What are you doing?\\\\\\\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.  \\\\\\\"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\\\\\\\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.  Neville stared at their guilty faces.  \\\\\\\"You're going out again,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"No, no, no,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?\\\\\\\"  Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.  \\\\\\\"You can't go out,\\\\\\\" said Neville, \\\\\\\"you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You don't understand,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"this is important.\\\\\\\"  But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.  I won't let you do it,\\\\\\\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \\\\\\\"I'll -- I'll fight you!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Neville, \\\\\\\"Ron exploded, \\\\\\\"get away from that hole and don't be an idiot --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Don't you call me an idiot!\\\\\\\" said Neville. I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yes, but not to us,\\\\\\\" said Ron in exasperation. \\\\\\\"Neville, you don't know what you're doing.\\\\\\\"  He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.  \\\\\\\"Go on then, try and hit me!\\\\\\\" said Neville, raising his fists. \\\\\\\"I'm ready!\\\\\\\"  Harry turned to Hermione.  \\\\\\\"Do something,\\\\\\\" he said desperately.  Hermione stepped forward.  \\\\\\\"Neville,\\\\\\\" she said, \\\\\\\"I'm really, really sorry about this.\\\\\\\"  She raised her wand.  \\\\\\\"Petrificus Totalus!\\\\\\\" she cried, pointing it at Neville.  Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.  Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.  \\\\\\\"What've you done to him?\\\\\\\" Harry whispered.  \\\\\\\"It's the full Body-Bind,\\\\\\\" said Hermione miserably. \\\\\\\"Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"You'll understand later, Neville,\\\\\\\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak.  But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.  \\\\\\\"Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\\\\\\\" Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.  They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.  \\\\\\\"Who's there?\\\\\\\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \\\\\\\"Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\\\\\\\"  He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.  \\\\\\\"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.\\\\\\\"  Harry had a sudden idea.  \\\\\\\"Peeves,\\\\\\\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \\\\\\\"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\\\\\\\"  Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.  \\\\\\\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\\\\\\\" he said greasily. \\\\\\\"My mistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I have business here, Peeves,\\\\\\\" croaked Harry. \\\\\\\"Stay away from this place tonight.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\\\\\\\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \\\\\\\"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.\\\\\\\"  And he scooted off  \\\\\\\"Brilliant, Harry!\\\\\\\" whispered Ron.  A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar.  \\\\\\\"Well, there you are,\\\\\\\" Harry said quietly, \\\\\\\"Snape's already got past Fluffy.\\\\\\\"  Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.  \\\\\\\"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"You can take the cloak, I won't need it now.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Don't be stupid,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"We're coming,\\\\\\\" said Hermione.  Harry pushed the door open.  As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.  \\\\\\\"What's that at its feet?\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered.  \\\\\\\"Looks like a harp,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Snape must have left it there.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Well, here goes...\\\\\\\"  He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.  \\\\\\\"Keep playing,\\\\\\\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \\\\\\\"I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\\\\\\\" said Ron, peering over the dog's back. \\\\\\\"Want to go first, Hermione?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No, I don't!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"All right.\\\\\\\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.  \\\\\\\"What can you see?\\\\\\\" Hermione said anxiously.  \\\\\\\"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop.\\\\\\\"  Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.  \\\\\\\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\\\\\\\"  Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.  Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.  He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \\\\\\\"If anything happens to me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"See you in a minute, I hope...  And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.  \\\\\\\"It's okay!\\\\\\\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \\\\\\\"it's a soft landing, you can jump!\\\\\\\"  Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.  \\\\\\\"What's this stuff?\\\\\\\" were his first words.  \\\\\\\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\\\\\\\"  The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.  \\\\\\\"We must be miles under the school , she said.  \\\\\\\"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"Lucky!\\\\\\\" shrieked Hermione. \\\\\\\"Look at you both!\\\\\\\"  She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.  Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.  \\\\\\\"Stop moving!\\\\\\\" Hermione ordered them. \\\\\\\"I know what this is -- it's Devil's Snare!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\\\\\\\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \\\\\\\"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\\\\\\\" said Hermione.  \\\\\\\"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\\\\\\\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.  \\\\\\\"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp  \\\\\\\"So light a fire!\\\\\\\" Harry choked.  \\\\\\\"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!\\\\\\\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands.  \\\\\\\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\\\\\\\" Ron bellowed. \\\\\\\"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh, right!\\\\\\\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.  \\\\\\\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\\\\\\\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.  \\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -- 'there's no wood,' honestly.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"This way,\\\\\\\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.  All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough...  \\\\\\\"Can you hear something?\\\\\\\" Ron whispered.  Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.  \\\\\\\"Do you think it's a ghost?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I don't know... sounds like wings to me.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving.\\\\\\\"  They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.  \\\\\\\"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"Probably,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll run.\\\\\\\"  He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.  The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.  \\\\\\\"Now what?\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration,\\\\\\\" said Hermione.  They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?  \\\\\\\"They're not birds!\\\\\\\" Harry said suddenly. \\\\\\\"They're keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean...\\\\\\\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \\\\\\\"... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But there are hundreds of them!\\\\\\\"  Ron examined the lock on the door.  \\\\\\\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle.\\\\\\\"  They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.  Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.  \\\\\\\"That one!\\\\\\\" he called to the others. \\\\\\\"That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\\\\\\\"  Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.  \\\\\\\"We've got to close in on it!\\\\\\\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \\\\\\\"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\\\\\\\"  Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.  They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.  \\\\\\\"Ready?\\\\\\\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.  The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.  They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.  \\\\\\\"Now what do we do?\\\\\\\" Harry whispered.  \\\\\\\"It's obvious, isn't it?\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"We've got to play our way across the room.\\\\\\\"  Behind the white pieces they could see another door.  \\\\\\\"How?\\\\\\\" said Hermione nervously.  \\\\\\\"I think,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"we're going to have to be chessmen.\\\\\\\"  He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.  \\\\\\\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\\\\\\\" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.  \\\\\\\"This needs thinking about\\the said. I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces....\\\\\\\"  Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \\\\\\\"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We're not offended,\\\\\\\" said Harry quickly. \\\\\\\"Just tell us what to do.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What about you?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I'm going to be a knight,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.  \\\\\\\"White always plays first in chess,\\\\\\\" said Ron, peering across the board. \\\\\\\"Yes... look...\\\\\\\"  A white pawn had moved forward two squares.  Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?  \\\\\\\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\\\\\\\"  Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.  \\\\\\\"Had to let that happen,\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking shaken. \\\\\\\"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\\\\\\\"  Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.  \\\\\\\"We're nearly there,\\\\\\\" he muttered suddenly. \\\\\\\"Let me think let me think...\\\\\\\"  The white queen turned her blank face toward him.  \\\\\\\"Yes...\\\\\\\" said Ron softly, \\\\\\\"It's the only way... I've got to be taken.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.  \\\\\\\"That's chess!\\\\\\\" snapped Ron. \\\\\\\"You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Ron --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\\\\\\\"  There was no alternative.  \\\\\\\"Ready?\\\\\\\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \\\\\\\"Here I go - now, don't hang around once you've won.\\\\\\\"  He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.  Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.  The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.  \\\\\\\"What if he's --?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He'll be all right,\\\\\\\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \\\\\\\"What do you reckon's next?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's.\\\\\\\"  They had reached another door.  \\\\\\\"All right?\\\\\\\" Harry whispered.  \\\\\\\"Go on.\\\\\\\"  Harry pushed it open.  A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.  \\\\\\\"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\\\\\\\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \\\\\\\"Come on, I can't breathe.\\\\\\\"  He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.  \\\\\\\"Snape's,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"What do we have to do?\\\\\\\"  They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.  \\\\\\\"Look!\\\\\\\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:  Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,  Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,  One among us seven will let you move ahead,  Another will transport the drinker back instead,  Two among our number hold only nettle wine,  Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.  Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,  To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:  First, however slyly the poison tries to hide  You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;  Second, different are those who stand at either end,  But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;  Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,  Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;  Fourth, the second left and the second on the right  Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.  Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.  \\\\\\\"Brilliant,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But so will we, won't we?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Of course not,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But how do we know which to drink?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Give me a minute.\\\\\\\"  Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.  \\\\\\\"Got it,\\\\\\\" she said. \\\\\\\"The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone.\\\\\\\"  Harry looked at the tiny bottle.  \\\\\\\"There's only enough there for one of us,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"That's hardly one swallow.\\\\\\\"  They looked at each other.  \\\\\\\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\\\\\\\"  Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.  \\\\\\\"You drink that,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?\\\\\\\" said Harry, pointing at his scar. \\\\\\\"I might get lucky again.\\\\\\\"  Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.  \\\\\\\"Hermione!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I'm not as good as you,\\\\\\\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.  \\\\\\\"Me!\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You drink first,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"You are sure which is which, aren't you?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Positive,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.  \\\\\\\"It's not poison?\\\\\\\" said Harry anxiously.  \\\\\\\"No -- but it's like ice.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Good luck -- take care.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"GO!\\\\\\\"  Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.  Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.  \\\\\\\"Here I come,\\\\\\\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.  It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.  There was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort.  \\\"\",\n          \"\\u00a0Harry had Herbology first thing the following morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being over-heard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The weekend\\u2019s brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse.\\u00a0\\\\Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,\\\\\\\" said Ron qui-etly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this terms project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. \\\\\\\"But I still don't get why Dumbledore's showing you all this. I mean, it's really interesting and everything, but what's the point?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Dunno,\\\\\\\" said Harry, inserting a gum shield. \\\\\\\"But he says its all important and it'll help me survive.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I think it's fascinating,\\\\\\\" said Hermione earnestly. \\\\\\\"It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"So how was Slughorn's latest party?\\\\\\\" Harry asked her thickly through the gum shield.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, it was quite fun, really,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, now putting on protective goggles. \\\\\\\"I mean, he drones on about famous exploits a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he's so well connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Gwenog Jones?\\\\\\\" said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles. \\\\\\\"The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"That's right,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Quite enough chat over here!\\\\\\\" said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern. \\\\\\\"You're lagging behind, everybody else has started, and Neville's already got his first pod!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Okay, Professor, we're starting now!\\\\\\\" said Ron, adding quietly, when she had turned away again, \\\\\\\"should ve used Muffliato, Harry.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, we shouldn't!\\\\\\\" said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his spells. \\\\\\\"Well, come on ... we'd better get going. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.\\u00a0It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in Hermione's hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermi-one snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like Neville's. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You know, I don't think I'll be having any of these in my garden when I've got my own place,\\\\\\\" said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Pass me a bowl,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at arm's length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Don't be squeamish, squeeze it out, they're best when they're fresh!\\\\\\\" called Professor Sprout.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Anyway,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conver-sation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, \\\\\\\"Slughorn's going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there's no way you'll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, \\\\\\\"And this is another party just for Slughorn's favorites, is it?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Just for the Slug Club, yes,\\\\\\\" said Hermione.\\u00a0The pod flew out from under Ron's fingers and hit the green house glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Sprout's head and knocking off her old, patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, \\\\\\\"Look, I didn't make up the name 'Slug Club' \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"'Slug Club,'\\\\\\\"repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. \\\\\\\"It's pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don't you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"We're allowed to bring guests,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, \\\\\\\"and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it's that stupid then I won't bother!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unno-ticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and be-gan to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of their conversation.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You were going to ask me?\\\\\\\" asked Ron, in a completely differ-ent voice.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" said Hermione angrily. \\\\\\\"But obviously if you'd rather 1 hooked up with McLaggen ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I wouldn't,\\\\\\\" said Ron, in a very quiet voice.\\u00a0Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it.\\u00a0\\u2018\\\\\\\"Reparo,\\\\\\\"' he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry's presence. Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of \\u201cFlesh-Eating Trees of the World\\u201d to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Hand that over, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Hermione hurriedly. \\\\\\\"It says we're supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump. It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he felt about it. ... He and Cho were now too em-barrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didn't split up? What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Gotcha!\\\\\\\" yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.\\u00a0The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughorn's party. Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what\\u00a0happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn's dimly lit room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries.\\u00a0Katie Bell was still in St. Mungo's Hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short. He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was loom-ing, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play.\\u00a0Harry did not think he could stand another full-House tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cor-nered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Hermione's creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Are you still interested in playing Chaser?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Wha \\u2014 ? Yeah, of course!\\\\\\\" said Dean excitedly. Over Dean\\u2019s shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnegan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have pre-ferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well then, you're in,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"There's a practice tonight, seven o'clock.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" said Dean. \\\\\\\"Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can't wait to tell Ginny!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamus's head as one of Hermione's canaries whizzed over them.\\u00a0Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katie\\u2019s substitute. There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his class-mates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If they lost. . . well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings. . . .\\u00a0Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only problem was Ron.\\u00a0Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortu-nately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It was an accident, I'm sorry, Demelza, really sorry!\\\\\\\" Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping blood everywhere. \\\\\\\"I just \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Panicked,\\\\\\\" Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. \\\\\\\"You prat, Ron, look at the state of her!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I can fix that,\\\\\\\" said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelzas mouth, and saying \\\\\\\"Episkey.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"And Ginny, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry forced himself not to laugh.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"In the air, everyone, let's go. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Good work, everyone, I think we'll flatten Slytherin,\\\\\\\" he said bracingly, and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I played like a sack of dragon dung,\\\\\\\" said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind Ginny.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, you didn't,\\\\\\\" said Harry firmly. \\\\\\\"You're the best Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together.\\u00a0It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harry's stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ron's voice as though from a great distance away.\\u00a0\\u201cOi!\\u201d\\u00a0Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around. \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Ginny.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I don't want to find my own sister snogging people in public!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!\\\\\\\" said Ginny.\\u00a0Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roar-ing for Dean's instant dismissal from the team.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Er . . . c'mon, Ginny,\\\\\\\" said Dean, \\\\\\\"let's go back to the common room. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You go!\\\\\\\" said Ginny. \\\\\\\"I want a word with my dear brother!\\\\\\\" Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron, \\\\\\\"let's get this straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron \\u2014\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Yeah, it is!\\\\\\\" said Ron, just as angrily. \\\\\\\"D' you think I want peo-ple saying my sister's a \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"A what?\\\\\\\" shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. \\\\\\\"A what, exactly?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"He doesn't mean anything, Ginny \\u2014\\\\\\\" said Harry automati-cally, though the monster was roaring its approval of Ron's words. \\\\\\\"Oh yes he does!\\\\\\\" she said, flaring up at Harry. \\\\\\\"Just because he's never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he's ever had is from our Auntie Muriel \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Shut your mouth!\\\\\\\" bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning maroon.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I will not!\\\\\\\" yelled Ginny, beside herself. \\\\\\\"I've seen you with Phlegm, hoping she'll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, it's pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done your self, you wouldn't mind so much that everyone else does it!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between them.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You don't know what you're talking about!\\\\\\\" Ron roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. \\\\\\\"Just because I don't do it in public \\u2014 !\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out of the way.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?\\\\\\\" You \\u2014\\u00a0A streak of orange light flew under Harrys left arm and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Don't be stupid \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Harry's snogged Cho Chang!\\\\\\\" shouted Ginny, who sounded close to tears now. \\\\\\\"And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it's only you who acts like it's something disgusting, Ron, and that's because you've got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breath-ing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Rich's cat, appeared around the cor-ner, which broke the tension.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"C'mon,\\\\\\\" said Harry, as the sound of Filch's shuffling feet reached their ears.\\u00a0They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. \\\\\\\"Oi, out of the way!\\\\\\\" Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.\\u00a0Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt dis-oriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this. It's just because she's Ron\\u2019s sister, he told himself. You just didn't like seeing her kissing Dean because she's Ron's sister. . . .\\u00a0But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same de-serted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead. . . . The mon-ster in his chest purred . . . but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like \\\\\\\"betrayal of trust\\\\\\\" . . . \\\\\\\"supposed to be my friend\\\\\\\" . . .\\u00a0\\\\\\\"D'you think Hermione did snog Krum?\\\\\\\" Ron asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone \\u2014 \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" he said confusedly. \\\\\\\"Oh ... er ...\\\\\\\" The honest answer was \\\\\\\"yes,\\\\\\\" but he did not want to give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry's face.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Dilligrout,\\\\\\\" he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room.\\u00a0Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in si-lence, each absorbed in his own thoughts,\\u00a0Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny for years now. ... It was natural that he should feel protective . . . natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her... No ... he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling. . . .\\u00a0Ron gave a great grunting snore.\\u00a0She's Ron's sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron's sister. She's out-of-bounds. He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything. He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny.\\u00a0Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater\\u2019s bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys' dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him.\\u00a0To Harry\\u2019s dismay, Ron's new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturdays match, he failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You shut up and leave her alone!\\\\\\\" shouted Peakes, who was about two-thirds Ron's height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"ENOUGH!\\\\\\\" bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering in Ron\\u2019s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accom-plished caster of the Bat-Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene be-fore things got out of hand. \\\\\\\"Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today, Ron . . .\\\\\\\" he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, \\\\\\\"you're my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I'm going to kick you off the team.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom. all the fight went out of him and he said, \\\\\\\"I resign. I'm pathetic.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You're not pathetic and you're not resigning!\\\\\\\" said Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. \\\\\\\"You can save any-thing when you're on form, it's a mental problem you've got!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"You calling me mental?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Yeah, maybe I am!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head wearily. \\\\\\\"I know you haven't got any time to find another Keeper, so I'll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I'm tak-ing myself off the team.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ron's confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever.\\u00a0Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Cap-tain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim. . . .\\u00a0If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull him-self together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . some-thing that would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . .\\u00a0And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration.\\u00a0Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen.\\u00a0The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron gri-maced weakly and shook his head.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Cheer up, Ron!\\\\\\\" called Lavender. \\\\\\\"I know you'll be brilliant!\\\\\\\" : Ron ignored her.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Tea?\\\\\\\" Harry asked him. \\\\\\\"Coffee? Pumpkin juice?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Anything,\\\\\\\" said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.\\u00a0A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of Ron's recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"How are you both feeling?\\\\\\\" she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ron's head.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Fine,\\\\\\\" said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice. \\\\\\\"There you go, Ron. Drink up.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke\\u00a0sharply.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Don't drink that, Ron!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Both Harry and Ron looked up at her.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Why not?\\\\\\\" said Ron.\\u00a0Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not be-lieve her eyes.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You just put something in that drink.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Excuse me?\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron's drink. You've got the bottle in your hand right now!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I dont know what you're talking about,\\\\\\\" said Harry, stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Ron, I warn you, don't drink it!\\\\\\\" Hermione said again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and said, \\\\\\\"Stop bossing me around, Hermione.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could hear her, she hissed, \\\\\\\"You should be expelled for that. I'd never have believed it of you, Harry!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Look who's talking,\\\\\\\" he whispered back. \\\\\\\"Confunded anyone lately?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0She stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go without regret. Hermione had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron, who was smacking his lips.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Nearly time/' said Harry blithely.\\u00a0The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Pretty lucky the weathers this good, eh?\\\\\\\" Harry asked Ron.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.\\u00a0Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Conditions look ideal,\\\\\\\" said Ginny, ignoring Ron. \\\\\\\"And guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey \\u2014 he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he's too sore to play! And even better than that \\u2014 Malfoy's gone off sick too!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. \\\\\\\"He's ill? What's wrong with him?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No idea, but it's great for us,\\\\\\\" said Ginny brightly. \\\\\\\"They're playing Harper instead; he's in my year and he's an idiot.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking?\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Fishy, isn't it?\\\\\\\" he said in an undertone to Ron. \\\\\\\"Malfoy not playing?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Lucky, I call it,\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking slightly more animated. \\\\\\\"And Vaisey off too, he's their best goal scorer, I didn't fancy \\u2014 hey!\\\\\\\" he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his Keepers gloves and staring at Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I... you . . .\\\\\\\" Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both scared and excited. \\\\\\\"My drink ... my pumpkin juice ... you didn't...?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, \\\\\\\"We'll be starting in about five minutes, you'd better get your boots on.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood's famous lion-topped hat.\\u00a0Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was stand-ing ready to release the balls from the crate.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Captains shake hands,\\\\\\\" she said, and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. \\\\\\\"Mount your brooms. On the whistle . . . three . . . two . . . one . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away.\\u00a0Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commentator's started up.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, there they go, and I think we're all surprised to see the team that Potter's put together this year. Many thought, given Ronald Weasley's patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship with the Captain does help. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned around on his broom to look toward the commentator's podium. A call, skinny blond buy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan's; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, and here comes Slytherin's first attempt on goal, it's Urquhart streaking down the pitch and \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harrys stomach turned over.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"\\u2014 Weasley saves it, well, he's bound to get lucky sometimes, I suppose. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"That's right, Smith, he is,\\\\\\\" muttered Harry, grinning to him-self, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch.\\u00a0With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindor's six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias won-dering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Of course, Coote isn't really the usual build for a Beater,\\\\\\\" said Zacharias loftily, \\\\\\\"they've generally got a bit more muscle \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Hit a Bludger at him!\\\\\\\" Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direc-tion. Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark.\\u00a0It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a\\u00a0rousing chorus of the old favorite \\\\\\\"Weasley Is Our King,\\\\\\\" he pre-tended to conduct them from on high.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Thinks he's something special today, doesn't he?\\\\\\\" said a snide voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. \\\\\\\"Your blood-traitor pal...\\\\\\\" Madam Hooch's back was turned, and though Gryffindors be-low shouted in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had already sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, de-termined to ram him back. ...\\u00a0\\\\\\\"And I think Harper of Slytherin's seen the Snitch!\\\\\\\" said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. \\\\\\\"Yes, he's certainly seen something Potter hasn't!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn't he noticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the , sky \\u2014 Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.\\u00a0Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smith's commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost. . . and now Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched. ...\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oi, Harper!\\\\\\\" yelled Harry in desperation. \\\\\\\"How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a dou-ble-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and caught it.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"YES!\\\\\\\" Hairy yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Ginny, where're you going?\\\\\\\" yelled Harry, who had found hint self trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of tin1 team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentators podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring,: Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, \\\\\\\"Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air ami waving to their supporters.\\u00a0The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. \\\\\\\"Party up in the common room, Seamus said!\\\\\\\" yelled Dean exuberantly. \\\\\\\"C'mon, Ginny, Demelza!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They were just about to leave when Hermione entered. She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined. \\\\\\\"I want a word with you, Harry.\\\\\\\" She took a deep breath. \\\\\\\"Yon shouldn't have done it. You heard Slughorn, its illegal.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"What are you going to do, turn us in?\\\\\\\" demanded Ron. \\\\\\\"What are you two talking about?\\\\\\\" asked Harry, turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning, \\\\\\\"You know perfectly well what we're talking about!\\\\\\\" said Hermione shrilly. \\\\\\\"You spiked Rons juice with lucky potion at breakfast! I'elix Felicis!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I didn't,\\\\\\\" said Harry, turning back to face them both.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes you did, Harry, and that's why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I didn't put it in!\\\\\\\" said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. \\\\\\\"I wanted Ron to think I'd done it, so I faked it when I knew you were look-ing.\\\\\\\" He looked at Ron. \\\\\\\"You saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He pocketed the potion again.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"There really wasn't anything in my pumpkin juice?\\\\\\\" Ron said, astounded. \\\\\\\"But the weather's good. . . and Vaisey couldn't play. ... I honestly haven't been given lucky potion?\\\\\\\" ]\\u00a0Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice. \\\\\\\"You added Felix Felicis to Ron\\u2019s juice this morning, that's why he saved everything! See! I can save goals without help, Hermione!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I never said you couldn't \\u2014 Ron, you thought you'd been given it too!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Er,\\\\\\\" said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this, \\\\\\\"shall. . . shall we go up to the party, then?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You go!\\\\\\\" said Hermione, blinking back tears. \\\\\\\"I'm sick of Ron at the moment, I don't know what I'm supposed to have done. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And she stormed out of the changing room too.\\u00a0Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermi-one that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred so long ago.\\u00a0Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated him-self from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorn's Christmas party with him. As he was duck-ing toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Looking for Ron?\\\\\\\" she asked, smirking. \\\\\\\"He's over there, the filthy hypocrite.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It looks like he's eating her face, doesn't it?\\\\\\\" said Ginny dispas-sionately. \\\\\\\"But I suppose he's got to refine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold.\\u00a0Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whip-ping out of sight.\\u00a0He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside , seemed to be deserted.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Hermione?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small ring of twit-tering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spell-work at a time like this.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, hello, Harry,\\\\\\\" she said in a brittle voice. \\\\\\\"I was just practicing.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah . . . they're \\u2014 er \\u2014 really good. ...\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, \\\\\\\"Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Er . . . does he?\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Don't pretend you didn't see him,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"He wasn't exactly hiding it, was \\u2014 ?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0The door behind them burst open. To Harry's horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand. ; '\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oops!\\\\\\\" said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, gig-gling. The door swung shut behind her.\\u00a0There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, \\\\\\\"Hi, Harry! Wondered where you'd got to!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds con-tinued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You shouldn't leave Lavender waiting outside,\\\\\\\" she said quietly. \\\\\\\"She'll wonder where you've gone.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oppugno!\\\\\\\" came a shriek from the doorway.\\u00a0Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Gerremoffme!\\\\\\\" he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34,\n          37,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          6,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
